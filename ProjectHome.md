**This library is now deprecated. The individual extensions have been released as separate projects. See the Concordion [Extensions](http://www.concordion.org/Extensions.html) page for details.**


[Concordion](http://www.concordion.org) is an open source tool for writing automated acceptance tests in Java.

This project enables extra features in Concordion, such as embedding screenshots or logging information in the output.

The downloads include a project that demonstrates the extensions using Concordion with Selenium WebDriver for end-to-end browser testing.

See the [documentation](http://concordion.org/ExtensionsLibrary.html) for more details.
